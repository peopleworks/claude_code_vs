# CLAUDE.md

Operating context for Claude Code when working in this repo. Future work and release plan live in `ROADMAP.md`.

## What this is

A native **Visual Studio 2026 extension** that launches the real `claude` CLI and implements Claude Code's **IDE-integration protocol** (lockfile + localhost WebSocket speaking MCP/JSON-RPC 2.0). The CLI does all agent work; this extension provides the IDE half: a **native diff window with accept/reject** and **automatic selection + diagnostics context**. We do *not* reimplement the agent, and we do *not* build skills/plugins/hooks - those come from the CLI for free.

If you ever find yourself adding an LLM API call, an agent loop, or a tool the CLI already provides, stop - that's out of scope.

## Working agreement (how we collaborate here)

- **Build in chunks, then teach.** Run free on a defined chunk of work (a phase or a well-scoped task), then - before moving on - explain everything the user needs to know/learn about what was built. The user is shipping this *and* learning the domain (VS SDK, the Claude Code IDE protocol) along the way, so keep code and decisions explainable and don't bury rationale.
- **Ask before design decisions with tradeoffs.** When a fork has real tradeoffs (not a choice with an obvious default), surface it with a recommendation and let the user decide. Decisions clearly load-bearing in the existing code don't need re-asking.
- **Ask when an instruction is unclear** rather than guessing and running.

## Architecture (where things live)

- `src/ClaudeCodeVS.Protocol/` - lockfile writer, WS server, MCP/JSON-RPC framing.
- `src/ClaudeCodeVS/Tools/` - one `IIdeTool` per tool: the 12 IDE-protocol tools (openDiff, openFile, getDiagnostics, …) plus the debugger surface - `DebugTools.cs` (reads) + `DriveTools.cs` (gated drive) - plus the semantic surface - `SemanticTools.cs` (the 8 `vs-semantic` Roslyn navigation tools, incl. `vs_get_selection` + `vs_decompile`) - plus the test surface - `TestTools.cs` (list/run/rerun-failed/debug/hunt/catch, on `vs-debug`).
- `src/ClaudeCodeVS/CodeModel/` - `RoslynReader` (the semantic-model reader: search/find-references/go-to-definition/find-implementations/call-&-type-hierarchy over the live `VisualStudioWorkspace`, **plus `FindTestMethodsAsync`** = Roslyn test discovery). The static-analysis twin of `Debugging/DebuggerReader`; backs the `vs-semantic` MCP server. Roslyn binds **in-proc** (unlike ClrMD) - `VisualStudioWorkspace` is the supported extension entry point.
- `src/ClaudeCodeVS/Testing/` - the test-runner: `TestRunner` (drives VS's Test Explorer engine in-proc via MEF `IRequestFactory` - list/run/debug/flaky-hunt/catch), `HuntState` (async background flaky-hunt registry), `TestResultCallback` (the `Reflection.Emit`'d internal `ITestWindowDataCallback` that captures real per-test results). Backs the test tools on the `vs-debug` server; see the Test-integration section.
- `src/ClaudeCodeVS/Diff/` - diff rendering + Accept/Reject InfoBar + write-back + tab registry.
- `src/ClaudeCodeVS/Editor/` - selection service + TextViewListener MEF component + Error List reader + RDT helpers.
- `src/ClaudeCodeVS/Debugging/` - `DebuggerReader` (EnvDTE reads: break state, stack, locals, threads, object-graph expansion, `$exception`, processes) + `DebuggerDriver` (EnvDTE/`IVsDebugger` drive: continue/step/breakpoints/session, break-on-thrown via `EnvDTE90.Debugger3`, attach/detach + the await-break engine).
- `src/ClaudeCodeVS/Hooks/` - hook installer (`PermissionHookInstaller`) + `McpInstaller` (registers BOTH the `vs-debug` and `vs-semantic` MCP servers) + embedded scripts: `vs-permission-hook.ps1`, `vs-usage-hook.ps1`, `vs-debug-context-hook.ps1`, `vs-mcp-shim.ps1` (one shim, parameterized by `-Route` so it backs both servers: `/mcp` = vs-debug, `/mcp-semantic` = vs-semantic).
- `src/ClaudeCodeVS/Ui/` - dockable panel (BridgeStatus state, ClaudeToolWindowControl WPF, ReasonDialog).
- `BridgeHost.cs` - wires everything together; owns the `/permission` handler and CLI launcher.
- `spike/` - Phase 0 standalone console harness (net8.0), kept for protocol regression testing.
- `src/ClaudeCodeVS.ClrMdWorker/` - out-of-process ClrMD worker exe (net48/x64): `waitchains`/`asyncstacks`/`heapstats`/`threadpool`/`roots`/`heapdiff` commands emit JSON; bundled in the .vsix under `ClrMdWorker\` and shelled out by `Debugging/ClrMdReader.cs` (ClrMD can't load in-proc in devenv — Immutable binding conflict). To iterate on a ClrMD read, run the worker exe directly against a target PID (no VS needed).
- `src/ClaudeCodeVS.DataBpComponent/` - the **managed data-breakpoint** Concord (DkM) debug-engine component (net472): an `IDkmCallStackFilter` + `IDkmDataBreakpointHitNotification` registered via `.vsdconfig` (a `DebuggerEngineExtension` VSIX asset). Arms `DkmPendingDataBreakpoint`s from the request thread and streams changes over file-IPC; driven by `Debugging/DataBreakpointBridge.cs` + the `vs_set/get/remove_data_breakpoint` tools (`Tools/DataBpTools.cs`).

## Tech stack & hard constraints

- **In-proc VSIX, `net48`, VSSDK + Community Toolkit.** The differencing service, Roslyn workspace, RDT, and editor adapters are in-proc services; the out-of-process `VisualStudio.Extensibility` model can't host them. Do not propose migrating the diff core to it.
- **WebSocket = `HttpListener`** bound to `127.0.0.1` only. No third-party WS/agent libraries.
- **Manifest targets `[17.14, 19.0)`** (VS Marketplace requires a stable API lower bound; 18.0 is experimental). Extension is tested on VS 2026 only; VS 2022 verification is a future item - see `ROADMAP.md`.

## Non-negotiable conventions

1. **Threading.** The WS receive loop runs off-thread. *Every* call that touches the editor, solution, diff, or any VS service must first:
   ```csharp
   await ThreadHelper.JoinableTaskFactory.SwitchToMainThreadAsync(ct);
   ```
   This is the #1 source of bugs. Never call VS SDK APIs from the socket thread directly.
2. **Localhost + auth only.** Bind to `127.0.0.1`. Validate `x-claude-code-ide-authorization` against the lockfile token during the HTTP upgrade; reject mismatches with 401 before the socket opens. Never log the auth token.
3. **`openDiff` is deferred.** Do not reply to the `tools/call` until the user accepts/rejects. Park the response on a `TaskCompletionSource` keyed by `tab_name`; complete it from the Accept/Reject handlers. Returning early breaks the flow.
4. **Return-value wire format.** Plain strings are sent verbatim (`"DIFF_ACCEPTED"`, `"DIFF_REJECTED"`, `"FILE_SAVED"`, `"TAB_CLOSED"`); objects are JSON-wrapped; errors use the MCP `isError` flag.
5. **Lockfile lifecycle.** Write on connect, delete on shutdown, reap stale (dead-PID) lockfiles on startup. A stale lockfile with a dead socket blocks reconnection - tie lockfile lifetime to the WS connection.

## Protocol quick reference

Lockfile `~/.claude/ide/<port>.lock` (filename == port):
```json
{ "pid": 0, "pidStartTime": 0, "workspaceFolders": ["..."], "ideName": "Visual Studio",
  "transport": "ws", "runningInWindows": true, "authToken": "<uuid>" }
```
`pidStartTime` is extension-only (the CLI ignores unknown fields): paired with `pid` so a recycled PID can't make a dead lockfile look alive. Hooks pick the **most-specific** workspace match whose port is **listening** (defeats parent-folder shadowing + zombie lockfiles).

Env before launching CLI: `CLAUDE_CODE_SSE_PORT=<port>`, `ENABLE_IDE_INTEGRATION=true`.
Full schema + all 12 tool definitions: see `src/ClaudeCodeVS/Tools/` and the Tool status section below.

**WS handshake (verified vs CLI 2.1.169, spike):** the upgrade request carries `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: mcp` - **echo it in the 101 response or the CLI drops the socket before `initialize`**. MCP `protocolVersion` is `2025-11-25` (echo the client's). After `initialize`+`notifications/initialized`, the CLI sends an `ide_connected` notification `{pid}` and proactively calls `closeAllDiffTabs`. Implementation: `IdeWebSocketServer.cs` + `McpServer.cs`.

## Tool status

All 12 tools are implemented. The CLI exposes only `getDiagnostics` + `executeCode` to the model; `openDiff`, `openFile`, `close_tab`, `closeAllDiffTabs`, and `selection_changed` are driven by the CLI internally (not model choices). The remaining awareness tools are implemented and correct but dormant in the current CLI.

| Tool | Status |
|---|---|
| `openFile` | ✅ real |
| `openDiff` | ✅ real - deferred TCS, InfoBar, write-back |
| `getCurrentSelection` / `getLatestSelection` | ✅ real |
| `getDiagnostics` | ✅ real - Error List backend (C# + C++) |
| `getOpenEditors` / `getWorkspaceFolders` / `checkDocumentDirty` / `saveDocument` | ✅ real (RDT-backed) |
| `close_tab` / `closeAllDiffTabs` | ✅ real (DiffRegistry) |
| `executeCode` | ✅ MCP error (no VS equivalent) |
| `selection_changed` notification | ✅ real - 150 ms debounce |

- [x] Phase 0 - spike: protocol verified end-to-end vs CLI 2.1.169
- [x] Phase 1 - core 4 in VSIX
- [x] Phase 2 - full 12-tool parity + single-gate hook + dockable panel
- [ ] Phase 3 - VS 2022 backfill, Roslyn-precise ranges (reconnect/multi-window hardening ✅ shipped 1.2.0)
- [ ] Phase 4 - embedded chat (deferred)

## Debugger integration (1.2.0; 1.3.0 adds attach + break-on-thrown)

Live debugger exposed to the model over the SAME bridge (full reference: `docs/DEBUGGER.md`). Three channels — needed because the IDE-protocol WS tools are CLI-curated (dormant), so you CAN'T add a model-callable tool there:

- **Push** - `vs-debug-context-hook.ps1` (a `UserPromptSubmit` hook) POSTs to `/debug-context`; the bridge reads break state via EnvDTE and the hook injects it as `additionalContext`. Break-mode only.
- **Pull** - a SECOND `McpServer` served at `POST /mcp` on the same `HttpListener`, reached by `vs-mcp-shim.ps1` (a stdio↔HTTP proxy auto-registered in the workspace `.mcp.json` as server `vs-debug`). The shim does the most-specific-listening-lockfile discovery; tool logic runs in-proc against EnvDTE. This is the OPEN plugin door (all tools surfaced), unlike the curated IDE channel.
- **Drive** - execution control on the same `/mcp` server, gated behind `BridgeStatus.AllowDebuggerDrive` (panel toggle, default OFF, resets per session - mirrors auto-accept). Async "issue → await next break" via `IVsDebuggerEvents.OnModeChange` + a parked `TaskCompletionSource` (the openDiff deferred pattern); never blocks the UI thread.

**32 tools** on `vs-debug` (+ the push hook) — the three newest are managed **data breakpoints** (see below). Reads: `vs_debug_state` / `vs_evaluate` / `vs_expand` / `vs_get_frame_locals` (optional `threadId` reads **another thread's** locals — e.g. each thread in a deadlock) / `vs_list_breakpoints` / `vs_threads` / `vs_exception` / `vs_list_processes` / `vs_wait_chains` (structured monitor ownership + deadlock suspects, ClrMD) / `vs_async_stacks` (logical async-stack reconstruction, ClrMD) / `vs_heap_stats` / `vs_threadpool` (starvation) / `vs_gc_roots` (retention path) / `vs_heap_diff` (leak finder) — the last four are ClrMD memory/GC/threadpool. Drive: continue, step over/into/out, run_to_line, `vs_break_all` (pause a running/hung debuggee — the way into a deadlock, which never hits a breakpoint), set/remove_breakpoint (file:line **or by function name**), `vs_break_on_thrown` (first-chance exception break), freeze_thread, set_next_statement, start/stop_debugging, `vs_attach`/`vs_detach` (debug a running real app, not just F5). Per-thread inspection (`vs_get_frame_locals` / `vs_evaluate` / `vs_expand` all take an optional `threadId`) and `vs_break_all` are pure EnvDTE (`Debugger.Break` + a `Debugger.CurrentThread` switch-and-restore) — no AD7; `vs_threads` surfaces a contended-lock holder as `lockOwnerThreadId`. All EnvDTE access is on the UI thread (convention #1). Capped reads carry a `{truncated:true}` marker so the model knows data was cut. Fixtures: `demo/{CheckoutBuggy,SignalScan,ComboScore,NullOrigin,WebQuote,LockJam,AsyncTrace}` (WebQuote = ASP.NET attach + break-on-thrown, live-verified 1.3.0; LockJam = deadlock triage via `vs_threads`/`vs_break_all`; AsyncTrace = cross-await inspection).

**Break-on-thrown is the managed `EnvDTE90.Debugger3.ExceptionGroups.SetBreakWhenThrown` API — NOT the low-level COM `IDebugEngine2.SetException`.** An earlier note wrongly claimed it needed AD7; the real blocker was just casting `DTE.Debugger` up to `Debugger3` (the member doesn't exist on the base `EnvDTE.Debugger`). Verified live on the modern Concord engine (1.3.0). **Lock/wait-chain ownership, async stacks, and memory/GC/threadpool diagnostics now ship via ClrMD** (1.5.0 + 1.6.0): `vs_wait_chains` (structured monitor ownership + deadlock suspects), `vs_async_stacks` (logical async stack), `vs_heap_stats` (heap composition + GC/handle/finalizer health), `vs_threadpool` (counts + backlog + starvation), `vs_gc_roots` (retention path / why-alive), `vs_heap_diff` (leak finder). Both run ClrMD **out-of-process** in `ClrMdWorker.exe` — in-proc ClrMD collides with devenv's `System.Collections.Immutable` binding policy (`MissingMethodException` on `DataTarget.get_ClrVersions`; un-overridable from an in-proc extension), so the worker carries its own `.exe.config` and the extension shells out + parses JSON. The snapshot is a `PssCaptureSnapshot` fork, so it coexists with the live VS session. `vs_threads` still adds the explicit `[Waiting on lock owned by Thread 0x..]` edge (which object a waiter wants isn't ClrMD-decodable — cross-reference the two).

**Managed data breakpoints ship via a bundled Concord debug-engine component** (1.8.1) — the one debugger gap with NO EnvDTE/automation surface (VS's UI can't set it programmatically either). Tools: `vs_set_data_breakpoint(expression, condition?, stopOnChange?)` (watch an instance `owner.field`; structured change timeline; conditional + **recurring** stop-on-change; multi-watch), `vs_get_data_changes(requestId)` (the `[{previous,current,type}]` mutation trace), `vs_remove_data_breakpoint(requestId)` (disarm). The component (`src/ClaudeCodeVS.DataBpComponent/`, a `DebuggerEngineExtension` VSIX asset) arms from the **request thread** (`IDkmCallStackFilter`) via `DkmSuccessEvaluationResult.GetDataBreakpointInfo` on the owner→field child + `DkmPendingDataBreakpoint.Create` with its **OWN** SourceId (reusing the engine's crashes the breakpoint manager) + async `Enable` (`BeginExecution`, never `Execute`). The engine can't halt from its hit notification (event thread), so the **extension** halts via EnvDTE `Break()` on a matching change; `Debugging/DataBreakpointBridge.cs` drives it over file-IPC under `%TEMP%\claude-codevs-databp\`. **One engine binding per address with fan-out** (the engine binds one data BP per address — a second `Create` on the same field shadows), so concurrent watches on the same value all fire. Watched fields must be **instance fields** (statics/locals/struct fields unsupported); stop lands one statement after the write. (First proven in a standalone Concord spike, since removed.) **Still not yet:** native tracepoints and all-primitive lock ownership (see `ROADMAP.md`).

## Diagnostics

Currently both C# and C++ diagnostics come from the **Error List** (`SVsErrorList -> IVsTaskList`) via `ErrorListReader.cs`. This is a single unified path that serves both languages - Roslyn pushes C# diagnostics into the Error List and the MSVC toolchain pushes C++ ones. Ranges are point ranges only (the Error List exposes one line/column per entry).

Roslyn-precise C# span ranges (`VisualStudioWorkspace -> Compilation.GetDiagnostics()`) are a Phase 3 enhancement - see `ROADMAP.md`. Always return `[{uri, diagnostics: []}]` - the envelope, even when empty. Requires a loaded project (the Error List is empty for loose files).

## Semantic navigation (1.9.0; `vs-semantic` MCP server)

The third knowledge axis (after runtime state and diagnostics): Roslyn's resolved **semantic model** of the code, exposed as 8 read-only tools so the model navigates by ground truth instead of grep. Full reference: `docs/SEMANTIC.md`.

- **A THIRD MCP server, `vs-semantic`**, served at `POST /mcp-semantic` on the same `HttpListener`, reached by the **same** `vs-mcp-shim.ps1` with `-Route /mcp-semantic`. `McpInstaller` registers both `vs-debug` and `vs-semantic` in `.mcp.json`. Wired in `BridgeHost.BuildSemanticTools()` -> `IdeWebSocketServer.SemanticMcp`. This is why a new IDE-channel tool wouldn't work (CLI-curated) - same reasoning as the debugger pull channel.
- **Tools** (`Tools/SemanticTools.cs`, backed by `CodeModel/RoslynReader.cs`): `vs_search_symbols` (name -> candidates, each with a stable `symbolId`) + `vs_find_references` / `vs_go_to_definition` / `vs_find_implementations` / `vs_call_hierarchy` (callers transitive, callees direct) / `vs_type_hierarchy` (base/derived) + `vs_get_selection` (the editor's current selection/caret via the existing `SelectionService`, enriched with the Roslyn `symbolId` at that position -> "act on this / navigate from it"). All ungated, managed (C#/VB) only, `{"available":false}` with no loaded project (the `vs_get_selection` text read works regardless; only its symbol enrichment needs Roslyn).
- **`vs_decompile`** (the headline read-a-library-body tool — the one thing the CLI fundamentally can't do): decompiles a framework/NuGet symbol with no source to C# via **VS's own metadata-as-source service** (`IMetadataAsSourceFileService.GetGeneratedFileAsync` with `MetadataAsSourceOptions.NavigateToDecompiledSources=true` — the Go-To-Definition decompiler, ILSpy under the hood). Reached by **pure reflection** against the already-loaded `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Features` (no new package): the service is a MEF export pulled via the `IMefHostExportProvider` on `workspace.Services.HostServices` (NOT `GetService<T>` — it's not an `IWorkspaceService`). Returns just the requested **member** (extracted via `MetadataAsSourceFile.IdentifierLocation` + a base-`SyntaxNode` walk; CSharp parse done by reflection, dep-free) or the whole type (`wholeType:true`), capped. **Stub-vs-body is signalled** (`bodyAvailable`): core BCL types forwarded to `System.Private.CoreLib` (String/Int32) only decompile to a signature stub — so on a stub the tool **auto-retries via SourceLink** (`NavigateToSourceLinkAndEmbeddedSources`, bounded 20s) to fetch the REAL .NET source; `preferSource:true` forces source-first. `source` = `decompiled|source`. Discovered the exact Roslyn-5.7 API shape headlessly with a `MetadataLoadContext` inspector before writing in-proc reflection — do that for any internal-API reflection.
- **Addressing**: every navigation takes a `symbolId` (Roslyn **DocumentationCommentId**, e.g. `M:Ns.Type.Method(System.Int32)`) OR a `file`+`line`(+`column`) position. `symbolId` round-trips via `DocumentationCommentId.GetFirstSymbolForDeclarationId`; position via `SymbolFinder.FindSymbolAtPositionAsync`. `file` paths are separator-normalized (`/`->`\`, case-insensitive) so agent-style forward-slash paths resolve. Workflow: search -> id -> navigate.
- **Threading is INVERTED vs the debugger**: the Roslyn `Solution` is an immutable, free-threaded snapshot, so we take the workspace handle on the UI thread (`GetSolutionOffThreadAsync`) then `await TaskScheduler.Default` to run `SymbolFinder` OFF the UI thread - no editor stall. (EnvDTE is UI-thread-bound end to end; Roslyn is not.)
- **Roslyn binds in-proc** - reference `Microsoft.VisualStudio.LanguageServices` with **`ExcludeAssets="runtime"`** (compile-time only; bind to devenv's own copy at runtime). The `.vsix` ships ZERO Roslyn DLLs - verify this on every build, a bundled copy is the `MissingMethodException` skew that exiled ClrMD. Unlike ClrMD, `VisualStudioWorkspace` IS the supported in-proc entry point, so this works. Fixture: `demo/RefMaze` (interface + 3 impls incl. an explicit one, an overload set, a call chain - every tool returns something grep gets wrong).
- **Callees is direct-only** (depth 1, via the language-agnostic `IOperation` tree - works for VB too). Callers is transitive (depth-capped, cycle-guarded). Output capped + `{truncated}`-signaled like the debugger reader.

## Test integration (1.10.0; the fix-verify loop)

VS's Test Explorer engine exposed to the model as a closed **discover → run → debug → catch** loop (full reference: `docs/TESTING.md`). The test tools live on the **`vs-debug` MCP server** (NOT a new server) — co-located with the debugger because the headline (`vs_catch_flaky`) composes with it. Backed by `Testing/TestRunner.cs` (+ `HuntState.cs`, `TestResultCallback.cs`) and `Tools/TestTools.cs`, wired in `BridgeHost.BuildDebugTools`.

- **Engine acquisition:** the in-proc `OperationBroker` via MEF `IComponentModel.GetService<IRequestFactory>()`. NOT the brokered `ITestWindowService` — its StreamJsonRpc/MessagePack wire contract drifted from the interface metadata (`RunTestsAsync` not proffered by name; `GetTestsAsync` wants a `FilteredTestsRequest` DTO). All `Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestWindow.*` types are internal → **reflection**, loaded from the install dir; the `.vsix` ships ZERO TestWindow DLLs.
- **Real per-test results need an emitted callback.** `TestWindowRunResponse.Success/Status` are IDENTICAL for pass and fail ("the run completed", not "the tests passed"); per-test outcome/message/stack come ONLY through the internal `ITestWindowDataCallback`. You can't implement an internal interface in C#/`DispatchProxy`, so `TestResultCallback.cs` **`Reflection.Emit`s** a type implementing it with `[IgnoresAccessChecksTo]`, forwarding each streamed `TestNodeData` to a managed sink. Set `TestCallbackOptions.DataSelector = TestSelectorOptions.New.WithTestResults()`.
- **Discovery is Roslyn, not the engine** (`RoslynReader.FindTestMethodsAsync`): scan for `[Fact]/[Theory]/[Test]/[TestMethod]/[TestCase]` → real FQNs. No callback, no build needed to list.
- **Filters:** `SearchQuery("FullyQualifiedName", fqn, FilterMatchKind.ExactMatch)` for `*ByFilterAsync`; `TestFilterOptions([Scope.ForSymbol(fqn)])` for `RunTestsAsync` (empty scope list = all; `Scope.ForState(TestState.Failed)` = re-run failures). `RunTestsAsync` rejects a NULL filter. `SearchQuery`'s accessible ctor is 5-arg and the enum member is `ExactMatch` (not `Exact`) — a bug that cost cycles; don't trust API shapes from metadata, dump the live object.
- **Flaky-hunt is async start+poll, NOT deferred-reply.** The `/mcp` HTTP shim has a ~60s per-request timeout, so a long hunt runs on a background `Task` (`HuntState` registry): `vs_hunt_flaky` waits ≤40s inline then hands back a `huntId`; `vs_hunt_result` polls, `vs_hunt_cancel` stops. (The `openDiff` "park a TCS + reply late" pattern only survives on the persistent WebSocket, not `/mcp`.)
- **`vs_catch_flaky`** (catch red-handed; gated behind `AllowDebuggerDrive`): loop a test under the debugger with break-on-thrown armed until the failing iteration halts at the throw. Reuses the debugger's OnModeChange await via `DebuggerDriver.LaunchAndAwaitBreakAsync(launch, timeout)` — fire a debug run, await Break (caught) vs Design (passed). Auto-learns the exception type from a pre-hunt; for a bare assertion (no type in the message) it arms the framework assertion base types (`Xunit.Sdk.XunitException` / NUnit / MSTest — break-on-thrown matches subclasses).
- **Self-builds** via `DTE.Solution.SolutionBuild.Build(true)` so tools never need a manual Ctrl+Shift+B. Engine + EnvDTE are UI-thread-bound (convention #1); Roslyn discovery hops off.

**Tools** (on `vs-debug`): `vs_list_tests` / `vs_run_test` (coverage ✅; profile deferred — needs a `ProfilerToolId`) / `vs_rerun_failed` / `vs_debug_test` / `vs_hunt_flaky` + `vs_hunt_result` + `vs_hunt_cancel` / `vs_catch_flaky`. Fixture: `demo/TestLab` (net10 xUnit: pass, assert-fail, throw, + two ~1-in-3 intermittent for the hunter/catcher). Follow-ups: run-affected (`Scope.ForFile/ForSymbol` + vs-semantic call-graph), profiling GUID, hunt idle-wait (`IOperationState`).

## Build / run / test

```powershell
# Extension (Release)
msbuild src/ClaudeCodeVS/ClaudeCodeVS.csproj /t:Rebuild /p:Configuration=Release

# Extension (Debug, then F5 in VS to launch the Experimental instance)
msbuild src/ClaudeCodeVS/ClaudeCodeVS.csproj /t:Rebuild /p:Configuration=Debug

# Spike (Phase 0) - fastest protocol loop; no VS needed
dotnet run --project spike
#   then: claude (with ENABLE_IDE_INTEGRATION + CLAUDE_CODE_SSE_PORT set) -> /ide
```

Protocol smoke test on every CLI bump (the contract is undocumented and has regressed before):
```powershell
claude --version            # record the known-good version
# launch spike, connect claude, confirm: lists mcp__ide__* tools,
# openDiff fires on an edit, accept/reject controls the outcome,
# /permission endpoint responds to a POST with the auth token.
```

## Gotchas

- **`Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: mcp` must be echoed** in the WS upgrade response. Without it the CLI connects (auth OK) then silently drops before `initialize` - looks like a mysterious disconnect. Undocumented; spike-confirmed vs CLI 2.1.169.
- Contract is **undocumented and version-fragile** - pin `claude --version`, smoke-test on every bump.
- `runningInWindows: true` changes how the CLI checks PID liveness (`tasklist.exe` vs `ps`).
- `new_file_contents` in `openDiff` is in-memory -> write to a temp file to feed the comparison; write to `new_file_path` only on Accept.
- Debounce `selection_changed` (~100–200ms) or you'll flood the socket.
