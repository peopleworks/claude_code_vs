# Changelog

## 1.13.0 - 2026-07-22

**Native terminal launch** — "Launch Claude Code" now opens `claude` inside VS's own docked Terminal tool window (the engine behind `View > Terminal`) instead of a separate `cmd.exe` console, so the CLI lives inside the IDE window like Developer PowerShell does.

### Features

- **`ITerminalService.CreateTerminalWindowAsync`, not a hand-rolled terminal.** VS 2026 exposes the real ConPTY-backed terminal engine as a public, ServiceHub-brokered service — undocumented (no NuGet package, no Learn page) but genuinely public types. Reached the same way this codebase already reaches VS's internal TestWindow engine (`Testing/TestRunner.cs`): reflection-load `Microsoft.VisualStudio.Terminal.dll` from the install dir at runtime, ship zero of its DLLs in the `.vsix`. The brokered-service plumbing itself (`IBrokeredServiceContainer`/`IServiceBroker`/`ServiceRpcDescriptor`) is a normal compile-time reference — already a transitive dependency of the VS SDK package. New: `Terminal/VsTerminalLauncher.cs`.
- **`claude`'s env vars are baked into the launch command**, since `TerminalWindowOptions`/`ProfileConfig` expose no `EnvironmentVariables` property: `cmd.exe /K set ENABLE_IDE_INTEGRATION=true&&set CLAUDE_CODE_SSE_PORT=<port>&&claude`, same `/K` trick as before so the tab keeps its scrollback after `claude` exits. The profile has to be registered via `ITerminalService.AddCachedProfile` first — without it, `TerminalWindowOptions.Profile` is silently ignored and the terminal opens with the default shell instead.
- **Falls back to the external `cmd.exe` console on any failure.** This is an undocumented surface that could change or vanish across a VS update, so `BridgeHost.LaunchClaudeAsync` tries the native terminal first and only falls through to today's `Process.Start(cmd.exe)` path if anything about the reflection call fails — logged via `Log.Warn`, never silent.

## 1.12.0 - 2026-07-17

**Attachments** — paste a screenshot or drop files onto the panel and an `@` reference lands directly in the CLI's input box. Closes the gap where the Windows CLI cannot paste images at all (upstream anthropics/claude-code#26679) and nobody wants to type absolute paths.

### Features

- **Attach tray on the panel** — drop files from Explorer, or **Paste** / Ctrl+V for clipboard screenshots (saved as PNGs) and copied files. Staged items render as chips: click to @-mention again (the recovery for the CLI dropping references sent mid-turn), ✕ removes (deletes our staged copy, never an in-place original), Clear empties. Items attached before Claude connects show ⏳ and flush on connect (200 ms settle, 25 ms spacing — claudecode.nvim's proven pacing).
- **Delivery is the IDE protocol's `at_mentioned` notification** (`{filePath, lineStart?, lineEnd?}`, insert-not-submit) — the message behind the official plugins' Alt+K. Spike-verified against the live CLI before building: an at-mentioned image path delivers **real pixels** to the model; workspace-relative and absolute paths both resolve. The spike harness gained `m`/`M`/`t` hotkeys + a probe-file generator (`--gen-attach-files`) so this stays regression-testable on CLI bumps, and its manual-connect hint now prints the PowerShell `$env:` form on Windows.
- **Token estimates before you send** — each chip's tooltip and a tray total show what reading the attachments will roughly cost (images by Anthropic's (w×h)/750 formula after the 1568 px downscale, so ~1.6k max per image; text at ~4 bytes/token; PDFs honestly show no estimate). Makes "crop your screenshot" and "have Claude grep the big log instead of reading it" visible before the tokens are spent.
- **One framework for every format.** Images (≤5 MB) / PDFs / text are read directly. BMPs transcode to vision-ready PNGs automatically. Everything else — Excel, video, archives — still stages and mentions, labeled 🧰: Claude gets the path and reaches for a script/tool (PowerShell, ffmpeg, …) since Read can't parse them. Oversized images attach with a downscale note; out-of-workspace files over 50 MB are @-mentioned in place instead of copied.
- **Staging that stays out of your way** — in-workspace files are referenced in place; screenshots and out-of-workspace files are copied to `<workspace>\.claude\attachments\` (so reads never hit an out-of-project permission prompt) behind a self-ignoring `*` gitignore, pruned after 7 days.

## 1.11.0 - 2026-07-10

**Notifications** — an in-IDE heads-up when Claude finishes a turn or needs your input, for anyone working in another window while it cooks.

### Features

- **"Claude finished responding."** — when a turn ends, an InfoBar appears across the top of the Visual Studio main window (auto-dismisses after 15s), and if VS isn't the foreground app its taskbar button flashes a few times. No new hook needed: the existing `Stop` usage hook's `/usage` POST doubles as the turn-end signal (a new `IdeWebSocketServer.StopReceived` event, raised before the transcript parse so a slow usage read never delays the notification).
- **"Claude needs your input."** — a new `Notification` hook (`vs-notify-hook.ps1`, same bridge-discovery boilerplate as the usage hook) POSTs the CLI's message to a new `/notify` endpoint when Claude hits a terminal permission prompt or goes idle waiting for input. This one stays up until dismissed or superseded, and it lands in the panel's activity feed.
- **A `Notify` panel toggle** mutes both. Default ON (it's a convenience, not a safety gate — unlike the two safety toggles), in-memory per session.

### Fixes

- **The hook/MCP installers silently dropped additions when merging into an EXISTING file.** Json.NET clones an already-parented `JToken` on re-assignment, so `root["hooks"] = hooks` detached the local reference and every subsequent mutation landed on an orphan — the file was rewritten without the new entry while the log claimed `ADDED`. Every prior rollout happened to hit the fresh-file path, so this first bit when 1.11.0 added the `Notification` hook to workspaces with an existing `settings.json`. Fixed in `PermissionHookInstaller` (both levels) and `McpInstaller` (`mcpServers` — this one mattered for marketplace upgraders with an existing `.mcp.json`): assign only when creating the token, mutate in place otherwise.
- **The Stop hook no longer waits on the transcript parse.** `/usage` held the hook's POST open until the whole transcript was parsed, which on a long conversation could blow the CLI's 10s hook budget (the `userHookTimeout` warning). The hook is observe-only, so the bridge now responds immediately and parses in the background.

### Notes

- One notification at a time: a new one supersedes the previous InfoBar (`Ui/Notifier.cs`, the same `IVsInfoBarUIFactory` machinery as the diff gate, hosted on the main window via `VSSPROPID_MainWindowInfoBarHost`).
- The taskbar flash is bounded (a few blinks, then the button stays highlighted) — deliberately *not* flash-until-focused, which would nag through a whole terminal conversation. It's skipped entirely when this VS instance is already foreground.
- Turn-end events log at `Event` level (Output pane only) so the panel feed doesn't gain a line per turn; needs-input logs at `Info` (visible in the feed).

## 1.10.1 - 2026-07-06

Two reliability fixes for the bridge.

### Fixes

- **The panel now warns when the pull-MCP tools didn't load.** The IDE WebSocket auto-connects at CLI startup, but the `vs-debug` / `vs-semantic` / test tools only work if the CLI *also* loaded our MCP servers over the stdio shim — which silently doesn't happen when Claude is launched outside the workspace folder, or the project MCP servers weren't approved. `BridgeHost` now arms a 10s grace window on connect and, if no `/mcp` handshake arrives, raises a panel banner with the remedy (relaunch from the panel / approve the project servers) instead of the tools just being mysteriously absent. Backed by a new `IdeWebSocketServer.McpActivity` signal; sticky per bridge, so a WebSocket reconnect of an already-proven session never re-warns.
- **The break-state hook no longer gets killed when VS's UI thread is busy.** The `UserPromptSubmit` debug-context hook hops to the main thread to read break state; if the UI thread was busy (a build, an F5 deploy, a modal dialog) that hop could block past the CLI's 10s hook budget and the hook's output was discarded. It now caps the hop at 2s and fails open with `{"mode":"unknown"}` (a busy UI thread means we're not paused, so there's nothing to inject anyway), and the PowerShell-side timeout drops 5s→4s to stay under the hook budget.

## 1.10.0 - 2026-07-02

**Test integration** — Visual Studio's Test Explorer engine as a closed **discover → run → debug → catch** loop, wired to the live debugger. `dotnet test` runs your tests; this lets Claude *stop inside a failing one* and *reproduce a heisenbug on purpose*. Full reference: [`docs/TESTING.md`](docs/TESTING.md).

### Features

- **`vs_list_tests`** — discover tests via Roslyn (methods marked `[Fact]`/`[Theory]`/`[Test]`/`[TestMethod]`/`[TestCase]`) → real fully-qualified names. No build needed just to list.
- **`vs_run_test`** — run one (by FQN) or all through Test Explorer's engine; returns real per-test `{outcome, errorMessage, errorStackTrace, durationMs}`, not a text blob. `collectCoverage:true` attaches a `.coverage` file. Self-builds first.
- **`vs_rerun_failed`** — re-run only the tests that failed in the last run (`Scope.ForState(Failed)`) — the classic fix-verify move.
- **`vs_debug_test`** — launch one test under the Visual Studio debugger; pair with `vs_break_on_thrown` to stop at the throw site with `$exception` and locals live.
- **`vs_hunt_flaky`** / **`vs_hunt_result`** / **`vs_hunt_cancel`** — force-reproduce an intermittent failure by hammering a test until it fails, capturing each failing run's real outcome/message/stack. Runs in the **background** (async start+poll: returns a `huntId` when it exceeds a ~40s inline window); `measureRate:true` estimates the failure rate.
- **`vs_catch_flaky`** — **catch a transient bug red-handed**: loop a test under the debugger with break-on-thrown armed until the failing iteration halts at the throw, paused inside the failure for inspection. Auto-learns the exception type (or arms the framework assertion base type for a bare assert). Gated behind the debugger-drive toggle.

### Notes

- The test tools live on the **`vs-debug` MCP server** (not a new server) — co-located with the debugger, because the headline feature composes with it. Backed by `Testing/TestRunner.cs` (+ `HuntState`, `TestResultCallback`) and `Tools/TestTools.cs`; discovery by `RoslynReader.FindTestMethodsAsync`.
- **Real per-test results come through an emitted callback.** The engine's `RunTestsAsync` return is identical for pass and fail; per-test outcome/message/stack come only through the internal `ITestWindowDataCallback`, which can't be implemented in C#/`DispatchProxy` — so we `Reflection.Emit` a type implementing it with `[IgnoresAccessChecksTo]`. The engine is acquired **in-proc via MEF** (`IRequestFactory`); the `.vsix` ships zero TestWindow DLLs.
- **Long hunts are async (start + poll), not deferred.** The `/mcp` shim has a ~60s HTTP timeout, so a multi-minute hunt runs on a background task and is polled — the `openDiff` deferred-reply pattern only works on the persistent WebSocket.
- New `demo/TestLab` fixture (net10 xUnit): a pass, a failed assertion, a throw, and two ~1-in-3 intermittent tests for the flaky-hunter/catcher. Verified end-to-end via the CLI tools and a raw `/mcp` suite.
- **Managed (.NET) test projects**, loaded solution required. Coverage works; **profiling is deferred** (needs a Diagnostics-Hub `ProfilerToolId`); the debug/flaky-catch tools are opt-in behind the debugger-drive toggle. Follow-ups: run-tests-affected-by-a-change, profiling, and an `IOperationState` engine-idle wait to make rate measurement robust.
- Removed the internal `vs_test_probe` diagnostic (a development-time acquisition canary) and the standalone `spike-concord/` proof-of-concept directory (the shipped data-breakpoint component lives in `src/ClaudeCodeVS.DataBpComponent/`).

## 1.9.0 - 2026-06-29

**Semantic code navigation** — Visual Studio's resolved understanding of your code (Roslyn), exposed as read-only tools so Claude navigates by ground truth instead of grepping text. The third knowledge axis after runtime state (debugger) and diagnostics. Full reference: [`docs/SEMANTIC.md`](docs/SEMANTIC.md).

### Features

- **`vs_get_selection`** — what the user currently has selected (or where the caret is) in the active editor: text, file, range — **plus the Roslyn symbol at that position with its `symbolId`** when the file is in the loaded solution. Lets Claude act on "this" / "the selected code" and navigate straight from it (selection → `symbolId` → references/callers). Reuses the existing `SelectionService` (which already fed the dormant `getCurrentSelection` IDE-channel tool); the text read works in any language, the symbol enrichment is C#/VB.
- **`vs_search_symbols`** — find declared symbols by name across the loaded C#/VB solution; each result carries a stable `symbolId` (Roslyn DocumentationCommentId) the other tools consume. The addressing primitive *and* the semantic "where is X declared."
- **`vs_find_references`** — semantic Find-All-References: resolves through interfaces, overrides, partial classes, generics, and explicit interface implementations; excludes comments/strings. The ground-truth "where is this used."
- **`vs_go_to_definition`** — the *right* definition among overloads / many same-named types. Address by `symbolId` or by `file`+`line` (cursor-style — disambiguates a specific call site).
- **`vs_find_implementations`** — concrete implementors of an interface/member, overrides of an abstract/virtual member, or derived classes of a base. Exact (grep's `: IFoo` misses indirect + explicit implementations).
- **`vs_call_hierarchy`** — `callers` (default): who **transitively** calls a method, as a depth-limited, cycle-guarded tree with call sites (impact analysis). `callees`: what it directly calls.
- **`vs_type_hierarchy`** — `derived` (default): subtypes/implementors; `base`: the base-class chain + implemented interfaces.
- **`vs_decompile`** — **read the body of a method in a referenced DLL** (framework or NuGet) that ships with no source — the one thing reading the repo fundamentally can't do. Decompiles to C# the way Go-To-Definition does (ILSpy), returning real implementation bodies. Returns just the requested member (`wholeType:true` for the whole type); marks `bodyAvailable` + `source` (`decompiled`/`source`). Core BCL types (forwarded to `System.Private.CoreLib`) only decompile to a stub, so it **auto-retries via SourceLink** to fetch the real `dotnet/runtime` source (bounded 20s; `preferSource:true` to force source-first).

### Notes

- New **`vs-semantic` MCP server** at `POST /mcp-semantic`, served by the *same* `vs-mcp-shim.ps1` parameterized with `-Route`. `McpInstaller` now registers both `vs-debug` and `vs-semantic` in `.mcp.json` (a one-time CLI trust prompt for the new server). Backed by `CodeModel/RoslynReader.cs` + `Tools/SemanticTools.cs`, wired via `BridgeHost.BuildSemanticTools()` → `IdeWebSocketServer.SemanticMcp`.
- **All read-only and ungated** (no execution, no mutation) — unlike the debugger drive tools, there's no toggle. **Managed (C#/VB) only**; returns `{"available":false}` when no project is loaded. Works any time a solution is open — no debug session required.
- **Roslyn binds in-proc.** `Microsoft.VisualStudio.LanguageServices` is referenced `ExcludeAssets="runtime"` (compile-time only → bind to devenv's own copy); the `.vsix` ships zero Roslyn DLLs. `VisualStudioWorkspace` is the supported in-proc entry point, so this works where in-proc ClrMD didn't. Queries run **off** the UI thread (the Roslyn `Solution` is an immutable, free-threaded snapshot) so navigation never stalls the editor.
- New `demo/RefMaze` fixture — an `IShape` reference maze (three implementors incl. an explicit interface implementation, an overload set, a call chain) where each tool returns something text search gets wrong. Verified end-to-end via the CLI tools and a raw `/mcp-semantic` suite.
- Output is bounded but signaled (`{"truncated":true}`), matching the debugger reader's convention. `callees` is direct-only for now (transitive callees + rename/refactor are on the roadmap).

## 1.8.1 - 2026-06-29

**Managed data breakpoints** — "break (or trace) when a value changes." This has *no* EnvDTE/automation surface and VS's own UI can't set it programmatically; we reach it with a bundled **Concord (debug-engine) component** driven over file-IPC. Full reference: [`docs/DEBUGGER.md`](docs/DEBUGGER.md).

### Features

- **`vs_set_data_breakpoint`** — watch a managed instance field (`owner.field`) while paused; streams every change (old→new). Optional `condition` (`> 700`, `== 0`, `!= 5`, …) and `stopOnChange` break execution on **each** matching change so you can inspect locals at the mutation. Multiple watches run concurrently — even several on the same value.
- **`vs_get_data_changes`** — the structured mutation timeline for a watch: `changes: [{previous, current, type}]` plus `broke`/`breakCount`. The "how did this value get here" trace — find the offending write, then set a normal breakpoint at that site.
- **`vs_remove_data_breakpoint`** — disarm a watch (Closes the engine binding).

### Notes

- New `src/ClaudeCodeVS.DataBpComponent/` — an IDE-level Concord component shipped in the VSIX as a `DebuggerEngineExtension` asset. It arms from the **request thread** (`IDkmCallStackFilter`), evaluates owner→field child for `GetDataBreakpointInfo`, and uses its **own** breakpoint SourceId (never the engine's — that crashes the breakpoint manager). The extension-side `DataBreakpointBridge` drives it over file-IPC under `%TEMP%\claude-codevs-databp\` and halts via EnvDTE `Break()` on a matching change (the engine can't halt from its hit notification). **One engine binding per address with fan-out**, so concurrent watches on the same value all fire and apply their conditions independently.
- **32** `vs-debug` tools total. `vs_set_data_breakpoint` is gated behind "Allow Claude to drive debugger"; `vs_get_data_changes` (read) and `vs_remove_data_breakpoint` (disarm) are not.
- **Managed instance fields only** — statics, stack locals and struct fields are unsupported by the engine. Debuggee must be .NET Core 3.0+ / .NET 5.0.3+, x64. The stop lands **one statement after** the write (the data breakpoint fires once the write completes — read the stack and set a normal breakpoint at the write site for an exact landing).
- Proven end-to-end first in `spike-concord/` (the full make-or-break ladder — Rung 0 component-loads → the cracked `DkmPendingDataBreakpoint`/`GetDataBreakpointInfo` arm chain → crash fix → halt-via-extension), then productized into the extension and verified live against the `DataBpTarget` fixture (conditional, recurring, multi-watch, disarm).

## 1.6.0 - 2026-06-27

ClrMD memory / GC / ThreadPool diagnostics — four new read tools on the same out-of-process worker. Full reference: [`docs/DEBUGGER.md`](docs/DEBUGGER.md).

### Features

- **`vs_heap_stats`** — memory snapshot: top managed types by total bytes (count + size), bytes per GC generation (gen0/1/2/LOH/POH), GC mode (server/workstation, regions, background), GC-handle counts by kind, and the finalizer-queue size + top finalizable types. The "what's using memory / what looks off" overview.
- **`vs_threadpool`** — ThreadPool health: worker counts (min/max/existing/busy/goal), queued work-item backlog, and a `starved` flag. Diagnoses the classic "async app hangs but nothing is deadlocked" bug — pool threads blocked (often sync-over-async) while work piles up. Pair with `vs_async_stacks`.
- **`vs_gc_roots`** — "why is this object alive?": give a type name or `0x`-address → the retention path from a GC root to an instance (each frame references the next), with `rootKind` (static field / thread-stack local / strong-or-pinned handle / finalizer queue). The leak root-cause tool.
- **`vs_heap_diff`** — leak finder: the first call baselines the heap; later calls report what GREW (per-type count/byte deltas, biggest first). A type climbing across repeated calls is the leak; then `vs_gc_roots` it. `reset` starts a fresh baseline.

### Notes

- **29** `vs-debug` tools total (14 read, ungated + 15 drive, gated). All four new tools are ungated reads on the existing out-of-process `ClrMdWorker.exe` (the snapshot is a `PssCaptureSnapshot` fork, so it coexists with the live VS session) — no new in-proc binding risk.
- New `demo/MemLoad` fixture leaks `byte[]` and starves the threadpool, exercising all four end-to-end.
- ClrMD heap walks (stats/roots/diff) can take longer than a lock read; the worker is given a 60 s budget and caps large enumerations with a `{truncated:true}` marker.
- Managed (.NET) only; threadpool stats need a .NET 6+ target. x64 targets.
- Tested against `claude` 2.1.191.

## 1.5.0 - 2026-06-27

ClrMD-powered structured concurrency analysis: exact lock ownership and logical async call stacks, run **out-of-process** so they coexist with the live VS debug session. Full reference: [`docs/DEBUGGER.md`](docs/DEBUGGER.md).

### Features

- **`vs_wait_chains`** — structured deadlock triage from a ClrMD process snapshot: every held monitor with its **owner thread + waiter count**, each thread's held locks and blocked state, and **`deadlockSuspects`** (threads that hold a lock *and* are blocked entering a monitor — the cycle members). Exact ownership, not parsed from stack text — a structured upgrade over 1.4.0's `lockOwnerThreadId`. Pair with `vs_threads` for the explicit "waiting on lock owned by thread X" edge. Live-verified cornering the LockJam 3-way deadlock.
- **`vs_async_stacks`** — logical async call-stack reconstruction: walks the heap's async state-machine boxes and returns each in-flight async chain (innermost first) with its await-point `state` — the `RunAsync → ComputeAsync → InnerAsync` chain the *physical* `MoveNext`/`ThreadPool` stack hides. The modern `dotnet/diagnostics` `!dumpasync` approach ported to ClrMD. Live-verified on AsyncTrace.

### Notes

- **Out-of-process by design.** ClrMD can't load in-proc in devenv — ClrMD 4.0 binds `System.Collections.Immutable` 10.0.0.7, but devenv ships its own Immutable versions and unifies them through a binding policy an in-proc extension can't override (`MissingMethodException` on `DataTarget.get_ClrVersions`). So a bundled **`ClrMdWorker.exe`** (net48/x64, with its own `.exe.config`) takes the snapshot in a separate process and returns JSON; the extension shells out and parses it. The snapshot is a `PssCaptureSnapshot` **fork**, so it reads a clone and **coexists** with the live VS debug session (verified at a Break All — VS continues cleanly).
- **25** `vs-debug` tools total (10 read, ungated + 15 drive, gated). Both new tools are ungated reads.
- The snapshot/VS-coexistence approach was proven end-to-end against a live VS-attached session before integration.
- Managed (.NET) only; x64 targets (the worker matches devenv's bitness; an x86 target would need an out-of-process x86 helper — future).
- Tested against `claude` 2.1.191.

## 1.4.0 - 2026-06-25

Deadlock-triage follow-ups to the 1.3.0 debugger surface — all pure EnvDTE, no AD7.

### Features

- **`vs_break_all`** — pause a **running or hung** debuggee (Break All / Ctrl+Alt+Break) and return the new state. The way into a deadlock, which never *hits* a breakpoint so there's nothing to stop on. A gated drive tool; rides the same await-break engine (`Debugger.Break(false)` → `OnModeChange`) as continue/step.
- **Per-thread inspection** — `vs_get_frame_locals`, `vs_evaluate`, and `vs_expand` all take an optional `threadId` (from `vs_threads`): they switch `Debugger.CurrentThread` to that thread, read/evaluate, and restore — so you can read a *non-current* thread's args/locals or drill `from.Id` on each thread in a deadlock, without it being the stopped thread. Reads stay ungated.
- **Lock-chain ownership in `vs_threads`** — a thread blocked on a *contended* lock now carries `lockOwnerThreadId` (the holder), parsed from Concord's `[Waiting on lock owned by Thread 0x..]` stack annotation and converted to decimal so it cross-references another thread's `id`. Follow the chain across threads → the deadlock cycle, straight from the flags.

### Notes

- **23** `vs-debug` tools total (8 read, ungated + 15 drive, gated). Tested against `claude` 2.1.191.
- New fixtures: **`demo/LockJam`** (five threads, a 3-node deadlock cycle buried in noise — a busy thread and an idle semaphore-waiter as negative controls) and **`demo/AsyncTrace`** (cross-await inspection: locals/`vs_evaluate` on an async continuation, and characterizing how much of the logical async call stack surfaces).
- **Live-verified on LockJam (Windows VS 2026):** `vs_break_all` paused the hang, `lockOwnerThreadId` formed the cycle, and per-thread `vs_evaluate('from.Id', threadId:…)` read each account — a fully tool-grounded deadlock diagnosis. Finding: a contended lock does **not** surface a `Monitor.Enter` frame (Just-My-Code or not) — Concord replaces it with the `[Waiting on lock owned by Thread]` annotation, which the heuristic now matches.

## 1.3.0 - 2026-06-24

Headline: **debug real, running apps.** Attach to a live process — a hosted web app, a service, an already-running desktop app — instead of only F5-launching a startup project, and break at the *origin* of an exception instead of where a generic catch swallows it. Builds on the 1.2.0 debugger surface; full reference: [`docs/DEBUGGER.md`](docs/DEBUGGER.md).

### Features

- **Attach to a running process** — `vs_attach` (by pid or name) + `vs_list_processes` (name-filtered) + `vs_detach`. Debug a hosted ASP.NET app (Kestrel / IIS `w3wp`), a Windows service, or an already-running desktop app — the real-app case F5 can't cover. Plain `Process.Attach()` selects the managed engine.
- **Break-on-thrown (first-chance exceptions)** — `vs_break_on_thrown` stops at the **throw site** of a named managed exception (e.g. `System.NullReferenceException`), even when a generic `catch` swallows it, so you see where it originates. Implemented via the managed `EnvDTE90.Debugger3.ExceptionGroups` API (not the low-level AD7 path).
- **Inspect `$exception`** — `vs_exception` returns the in-scope exception's type, message, and an expanded tree (incl. `InnerException` + stack) at a first-chance break or inside a catch block.
- **Function breakpoints** — `vs_set_breakpoint` now accepts a `function` name (e.g. `Namespace.Type.Method`) as an alternative to file:line — break wherever a method is entered, no source location needed. Conditions are supported.
- **Multi-process session shape** — `vs_debug_state` now reports `debuggedProcesses` (what you're attached to), surfaced in run mode too.
- **Concurrency triage** — `vs_threads` flags threads parked on a lock/wait (`waiting` / `waitOn`) to point at deadlock/contention suspects.

### Notes

- New fixture `demo/WebQuote` (ASP.NET Core) exercises attach + break-on-thrown end-to-end — verified live: the model attaches, arms break-on-thrown, triggers the request itself, lands at the throw site, inspects, and detaches.
- **22** `vs-debug` tools total (8 read, ungated + 14 drive, gated). Reading runtime state stays ungated; attach/detach, break-on-thrown, and execution control are gated behind the "Allow Claude to drive debugger" toggle.
- Tested against `claude` 2.1.186.

---

## 1.2.0 - 2026-06-17

Headline: **live debugger integration** — Claude can now see your program's runtime state, and (opt-in) drive the debugger to corner a bug instead of guessing from source. Full reference: [`docs/DEBUGGER.md`](docs/DEBUGGER.md).

### Features

- **Debugger awareness (push)** - when you submit a prompt while paused at a breakpoint, a `UserPromptSubmit` hook injects the live break state (stop location, call stack, current-frame arguments and locals with values) into Claude's context. No tool call needed; gated on break mode so normal turns stay quiet.
- **Runtime inspection (pull)** - a second MCP server, `vs-debug`, exposes on-demand read tools the model can call mid-turn: `vs_debug_state`, `vs_evaluate`, `vs_expand` (drill into an object graph), `vs_get_frame_locals`, `vs_list_breakpoints`, `vs_threads`. Reached via a tiny stdio shim auto-registered in the workspace `.mcp.json`; the tool logic runs in-proc against EnvDTE.
- **Drive the debugger (opt-in)** - behind a new **"Allow Claude to drive debugger"** panel toggle (default off, resets each session): `vs_continue`, `vs_step_over`/`into`/`out`, `vs_run_to_line`, `vs_set_breakpoint` (with condition + hit count), `vs_remove_breakpoint`, `vs_freeze_thread`, `vs_set_next_statement`, and `vs_start_debugging`/`vs_stop_debugging`. An await-break engine (`IVsDebuggerEvents.OnModeChange` + a parked completion) returns the new state after each step without blocking the UI thread.
- **Truncation signaling** - capped results (call stack, locals, threads, expanded members) now carry a `{truncated: true, …}` marker so Claude knows data was cut and can narrow its query, instead of silently seeing a partial picture.
- **Panel debugger stat** - the dockable panel's stats card now shows session attribution: *N inspected · M driven*.
- **Multi-instance + reconnect hardening** - hooks pick the most-specific workspace lockfile whose port is actually listening (defeats parent-folder shadowing and zombie lockfiles); lockfiles record `pidStartTime` so a recycled PID can't make a dead instance look alive; orphaned diffs are rejected and closed when the CLI disconnects.

### Known limitations

- Managed (.NET) debugging only; native/C++ runtime inspection is out of scope.
- `vs_evaluate` can't evaluate LINQ/lambda expressions (VS evaluator limitation).
- `vs_threads` gives per-thread stacks but not lock/wait-chain ownership.
- Break-on-thrown exceptions and native tracepoints are not yet implemented (planned - see `ROADMAP.md`).
- Tested against `claude` 2.1.181.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-06-15

Initial release. Implements the full Claude Code IDE-integration protocol for Visual Studio 2026.

### Features

- **Native diff with single-gate accept/reject** - Claude's proposed edits open in Visual Studio's diff viewer (not a terminal y/n). A PreToolUse hook intercepts every Edit/Write/MultiEdit and routes it through the diff; the CLI writes the file only after you accept. No duplicate terminal prompt.
- **Reject with feedback** - an InfoBar action in the diff that prompts for a reason; the reason is returned to the CLI as `permissionDecisionReason` so Claude reconsiders.
- **Run wild (auto-accept)** - a panel checkbox that allows edits without opening the diff, for unattended sessions. Resets each VS session.
- **Diagnostics sharing** - `getDiagnostics` reads the VS Error List (Roslyn for C#, MSVC toolchain for C++) and returns LSP-shaped diagnostics so Claude can see and fix your build errors.
- **Selection context** - a `selection_changed` notification (150 ms debounce) keeps Claude aware of the active file and highlighted lines in real time.
- **One-click Launch** - *Tools -> Launch Claude Code* opens a terminal pre-wired with `ENABLE_IDE_INTEGRATION` and the bridge port, working directory set to the solution root. Auto-installs the permission and usage hooks on first launch.
- **Dockable Claude Code panel** - connection status pill, accept/reject edit counts, token usage (input / output / cached) and estimated cost (latest call + cumulative session), pending-diff strip, and a curated activity feed. VS-theme-aware (dark/light).
- **Full 12-tool parity** - all tools advertised in `tools/list`: `openFile`, `openDiff`, `getCurrentSelection`, `getLatestSelection`, `getDiagnostics`, `getOpenEditors`, `getWorkspaceFolders`, `checkDocumentDirty`, `saveDocument`, `close_tab`, `closeAllDiffTabs`. `executeCode` returns an honest MCP error (no VS equivalent).
- **RDT-aware write-back** - accepting an edit updates an open editor buffer in place (no reload prompt) via `IVsRunningDocumentTable`.
- **Lockfile lifecycle** - stale (dead-PID) lockfiles are reaped on startup; the lockfile is deleted on clean shutdown and on an unexpected server fault.
- **WorkspaceWatcher** - keeps the lockfile's `workspaceFolders` in sync as solutions open/close so `/ide` always matches the current working directory.

### Known limitations

- Visual Studio 2026 only (VS 2022 backfill planned - see `ROADMAP.md`).
- Diagnostic ranges are point ranges (Error List only exposes line/column); Roslyn-precise spans are a future enhancement.
- The IDE-integration protocol is undocumented and version-fragile. Tested against `claude` 2.1.173.
- Token stats refresh on edits (the reliable hook trigger); a chat-only turn may not update them immediately.
- Cost figures are estimates (hardcoded per-tier list prices), not billing.
